# Wooting Analog Unreal Plugin

This repo contains a plugin for Unreal Engine v4.23 which provides Analog Keyboard input, using the [Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk)

## Plugin Usage
1. Download the plugin by clicking "Clone or download" and selecting "Download Zip"

2. In your project's root directory, create the folder "Plugins" if it doesn't already exist

3. Unzip the "WootingAnalogInput" folder from the downloaded zip into the "Plugins" directory

4. In your project root, right-click on your .uproject file and click "Generate Visual Studio project files" (You'll need Unreal Engine installed for this option to appear)

5. Open up your project in the Unreal Editor (by double clicking the .uproject file or otherwise). If prompted to recompile any files press yes

## Credits

* Many thanks to Valve for the open source [SteamVR Unreal plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unreal_plugin) which was a really good reference implementation to look at (as Unreal Engine plugin documentation seems to be fairly lacking)
